    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>Protein: Ground beef is the classic burger protein.</li>
        <li>Buns: Burgers are typically served on a hamburger bun, which is a round, sliced roll.</li>
        <li>Condiments: Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and pickle slices.</li>
        <li>Cheese: American cheese, cheddar cheese, and Swiss cheese are all common choices for burgers.
        </li>
        <li>Vegetables: Lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles are all popular burger vegetables.
        </li>
        
    </ol>

    <h3>Cooking methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare your cooking method:  You can grill, pan-fry, or bake your burgers. Whichever method you choose, preheat your grill or pan to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Shape your burger patties:  If you're using ground meat, gently form it into evenly sized patties.  Use a dimple in the center to help prevent them from puffing up in the middle while cooking.

        </li>
        <li> Cook the patties:  Place your patties on the preheated grill or pan. Cook for a few minutes per side, depending on the thickness and your desired level of doneness.

        </li>
        <li>Toast your buns (optional): While the burgers are cooking, you can toast the buns for a warmer, softer texture. You can do this on the grill or pan as well.

        </li>
        <li>Assemble your burger:  Place your cooked patty on the bottom bun. Add your favorite toppings like cheese, vegetables, and condiments.  Then add the top bun and enjoy!

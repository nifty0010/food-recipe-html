        <li>Gather your ingredients: You'll need lemons, sugar or a sweetener of your choice, and water.  Lemons are the tart star of the show, and sugar balances their pucker power.
        </li>
        <li>Wash the lemons:  Give your lemons a good rinse under cool running water.</li>
        <li>Juice the lemons: You can use a manual lemon squeezer or an electric juicer. If you go the manual route, consider rolling the lemons on a hard surface beforehand to loosen up the juice sacs inside.

        <li>Make simple syrup (optional): This combines sugar with a little water to create a concentrated sweetener that dissolves easily in your lemonade. Heat equal parts sugar and water on the stove until the sugar dissolves.  Let it cool before using.
        </li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients:  In a pitcher, combine lemon juice, water, and your sweetener of choice.
